These can be obtained by performing the Ritual of Binding near a relevant entity. See the full list of eligible entities in the Familiars section. Once you have obtained a Bound Script, use it to learn the familiar.",

Selecting a Familiar will summon it in the world and give you Familiar Sickness, preventing you from summoning another one for a short time. To obtain your first familiar, perform the Ritual of Binding near a Starbuncle. Familiars are bound to the player and cannot be transferred between books."
