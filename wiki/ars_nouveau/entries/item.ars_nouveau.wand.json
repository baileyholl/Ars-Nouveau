      "description": "Wands accept only a single spell, and are inscribed using the Scribes Table. A Wand always starts with Projectile -\u003e Accelerate, and MUST be inscribed with a spell that does not have another form. This allows you to cast spells beyond the 10 spell cap. If you want a wand that casts Break, inscribe the wand with JUST break, and your result will be a wand with Projectile -\u003e Acclerate -\u003e Break.",
