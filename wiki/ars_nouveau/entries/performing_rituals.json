      "description": "Performing a ritual requires a Ritual Brazier, and a tablet. Once you have obtained a tablet and brazier, place your brazier in the world and use a tablet on it. The brazier will ignite, and is awaiting activation. In this state, you may throw in any additional items as a way to augment the ritual. If you wish to augment a ritual, simply toss the item on top of the brazier.",

      "description": "To activate your ritual, interact with the brazier with an empty hand. Once activated, your ritual can no longer be augmented and has been consumed permanently. If a ritual requires source to operate, the brazier will pull from source jars within 6 blocks. Information related to rituals and their requirements can be found in their respective entries."
