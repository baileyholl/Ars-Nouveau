Filter scrolls can be used on the Catalog, storing the filter and applying it to all connected repositories when interacted with directly.",

Filters are not applied when items are extracted from other systems like a Hopper, and insertions via hopper will not respect the catalogs own filter, but will respect inserting into a filtered repository."
