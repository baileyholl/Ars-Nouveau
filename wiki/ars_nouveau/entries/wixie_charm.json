For example, if you want to craft Sticks, the Wixie will mix and match planks from nearby chests in order to fulfill the recipe. Each craft requires a small amount of source and will be drained from nearby Source Jars. A redstone signal on the cauldron will stop crafting."

Potions that require another potion as a base will be taken from nearby Potion Jars. A Wixie will output 3 doses of a Potion into a nearby Potion Jar when complete. To begin, place down an empty Potion Jar, right click the cauldron with an Awkward Potion, and supply Nether Wart from a nearby chest."
